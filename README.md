#Course Project

##Introduction:
This README provides details of my implementation of the course project for “Getting Cleaning Data” offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.com.

##Objective:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to download, merge, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a result tidy dataset that could support subsequent analysis.

##Activities to be done:
The project activities are provided in the “Getting and Cleaning Data” Course Project description at https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/human_grading/view/courses/973501/assessments/3/submissions

Create a R script called run_analysis() that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
1. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
1. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
